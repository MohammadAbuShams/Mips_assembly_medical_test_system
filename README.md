# Patient Medical Record Management System (MIPS Assembly)

## Overview:
This MIPS Assembly project for **Computer Architecture** Course implements a patient medical record management system. It allows users to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve medical test data for individual patients. The system is designed to handle basic patient record management, focusing on test results.

## Features:
 **File Format**: Medical test data is stored in a text file, with each line representing a single medical test. Each test includes fields for Patient ID, Test Name, Test Date, and Test Result.
 
 **System Functionality**:
   - **Add New Medical Test**: Allows users to store a new medical test with the required data. The system checks the validity of the input data.
   - **Search for a Test by Patient ID**: Provides various search options based on patient ID, including retrieving all patient tests, retrieving all abnormal patient tests, and retrieving tests in a specific period.
   - **Search for Abnormal Tests Based on a Specific Medical Test**: Retrieves all abnormal patient tests based on the input medical test.
   - **Calculate Average Test Value**: Calculates the average value of each medical test.
   - **Update an Existing Test Result**: Allows users to update an existing test result.
   - **Delete a Test**: Enables deletion of a test from the records.
